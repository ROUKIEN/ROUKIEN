# Hey !

I'm Julien (aka ROUKIEN). I'm a software engineer from southern France. I'm really interested in IoT stuff, microcontrollers & simple cloud infrastructures.

## What I'm working on

 * Writing some articles on some thoughs I had during working on freelance contracts (you might be interested if you ever had to deploy an SPA into a Docker container :-))
 * create rpis clusters & messing with K3S
 * Building a connected, contactless covid19-compliant coffee percolator machine. (Let's call it the CCCCCP machine). I'd love to make it implement the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol & expose REST endpoint through a self-hosted wifi endpoint !

## What I'm learning

 * I'm learning Golang by writing a [periph.io](https://periph.io) driver for a [Grove SHT31 temperature & humidity sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TempAndHumi_Sensor-SHT31) driver.
 * I'm trying to use [k3s](https://k3s.io) to deploy some existing real-world apps with complex deployment patterns (*you know, things you never encounter in hello-world tutorials like shutting down consumers before deploying your code, then restarting them*)
 * paradiddle on an electric drums ! ü•Å
