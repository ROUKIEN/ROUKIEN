# Hey !

I'm Julien (aka ROUKIEN). I'm a software engineer from southern France. I'm really interested in IoT stuff, microcontrollers, nodejs & simple cloud infrastructures.

## What I'm working on

 * Writing some articles on some thoughs I had during working on freelance contracts (you might be interested if you ever had to deploy an SPA into a Docker container :-))
 * create rpis clusters & messing with K3S
 * On my spare time I'm coding [the ruleless cards game](https://gitlab.com/ROUKIEN/the-ruleless-cards-game), an open source multiplayer game where you can do whatever you want with your cards

## What I'm learning

 * I'm learning Golang by writing a [periph.io](https://periph.io) driver for a [Grove SHT31 temperature & humidity sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TempAndHumi_Sensor-SHT31) -> [repo](https://github.com/ROUKIEN/sht31-influx-exporter).
 * I'm trying to use [k3s](https://k3s.io) to deploy some existing real-world apps with complex deployment patterns (*you know, things you never encounter in hello-world tutorials like shutting down consumers before deploying your code, then restarting them*)
 * being better at teaching stuff to others - any tips appreciated !
 * paradiddle on an electric drums ! ü•Å

## How to catch my attention

I really enjoy the following topics:

 * Nodejs
 * IoT
 * PHP
 * Feedbacks about unconventional solutions to uncommon problems
 * Automate all the things
