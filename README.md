# Hey !

I'm Julien (aka ROUKIEN). I'm a software engineer from southern France. I'm really interested in IoT stuff, microcontrollers, nodejs & cloud infrastructures.

## What I'm working on

 * create rpis clusters & experimenting stuff on K3S
 * On my spare time I'm coding [the ruleless cards game](https://gitlab.com/ROUKIEN/the-ruleless-cards-game), an open source multiplayer game where you can do whatever you want with your cards
 * automating anything

## What I'm learning

 * I'm learning Golang by writing a [periph.io](https://periph.io) driver for a [Grove SHT31 temperature & humidity sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TempAndHumi_Sensor-SHT31) -> [repo](https://github.com/ROUKIEN/sht31-influx-exporter).
 * I'm trying to use [k3s](https://k3s.io) to deploy some existing real-world apps with complex deployment patterns (*you know, things you never encounter in hello-world tutorials like shutting down consumers before deploying your code, then restarting them*)
 * being better at teaching stuff to others
 * paradiddle on an electric drums ! ü•Å
